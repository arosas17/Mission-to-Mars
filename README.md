# Mission-to-Mars


In the process of creating an app that will allow a person to scrape recent data of Mars, to further the presentation and quality of the application, the images of Mars' hemispheres from https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/. 

In order to complete this task, code was written to scrape the images' url and titles so that they be applied to a template later on. This is done locating the html code that would lead to the desired information through a for loop, obtaining all the information quickly. The image url and titles were then added to a list of dictionaries. 

This written code was then refactored to become a function and then added to the scaping.py file so that it may be used repeatable. The app.py was then ran to ensure the template were reflecting the images and titles correctly.

Lastly, bootstrap was used to improve visuals by making edits to the template in the index.html. Color was added to the webpage, with some background images as well. One major edit made was making the hemisphere images circle and then placing a background of space to give it a more stunning visualization. Another edit made was to increase the scraping button to a larger size to cover more the width of the screen. Besides these changes, there were edits made to make the webpage more mobile user friendly. Edits were also made to make the data neater.
